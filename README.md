Should work with most discord clients that allow custom theming.
Just add the following snippet to QuickCSS in your discord client.

```
:root, .content__4bf10{
    background: transparent!important;
    background-color: transparent !important;
    }
```

- Transparent theme
- Pywal theme (generate your own)
- Solid theme
